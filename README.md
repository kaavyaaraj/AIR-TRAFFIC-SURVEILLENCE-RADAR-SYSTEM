Air surveillance is a type of surveillance focused on
scanning the air space to detect and track airborne targets. One of the
common sensors used for air surveillance is the air surveillance
radar. 

Typical radar employs directional antenna (which is
mechanically rotated at constantrate)to transmit pulsed waveforms
and receive echoes reflected from targets. 
By analyzing received echoes, presence of targets can be detected and observations (called plots in
radar jargon) can be “extracted”.Plot is a measurement vector
containing measurements of time, azimuth and range, atleast. 

This project shows how to generate an air traffic control scenario, simulate radar detections from an airport surveillance radar (ASR), and configure a global nearest neighbor (GNN) tracker to track the
simulated targets using the radar detections. 

This enables you to
evaluate different target scenarios, radar requirements, and
tracker configurations without needing access to costly aircraft or
equipment.
